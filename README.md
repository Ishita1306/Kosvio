# InsightFlow

Production-quality SaaS foundation for a business intelligence platform.

## Overview

InsightFlow is structured using clean architecture principles. This repository
contains the project scaffold only — no dashboards, analytics, forecasting,
machine learning, charts, or AI features are implemented yet.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+

## Getting Started

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate      # macOS / Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Development

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
- Keep business logic out of `app.py`; route through services and components.
- Add feature code only within the appropriate layer directory.
